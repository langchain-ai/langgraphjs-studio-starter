   * Messages track the primary execution state of the agent.

   * Typically accumulates a pattern of:
   *
   * 1. HumanMessage - user input
   * 2. AIMessage with .tool_calls - agent picking tool(s) to use to collect
   *     information
   * 3. ToolMessage(s) - the responses (or errors) from the executed tools
   * 
   *     (... repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed ...)
   * 4. AIMessage without .tool_calls - agent responding in unstructured
   *     format to the user.
   *
   * 5. HumanMessage - user responds with the next conversational turn.
   *
   *     (... repeat steps 2-5 as needed ... )
   * 
   * Merges two lists of messages, updating existing messages by ID.
   *
   * By default, this ensures the state is "append-only", unless the
   * new message has the same ID as an existing message.
   *
   * Returns:
   *     A new list of messages with the messages from \`right\` merged into \`left\`.
   *     If a message in \`right\` has the same ID as a message in \`left\`, the
   *     message from \`right\` will replace the message from \`left\`.`
